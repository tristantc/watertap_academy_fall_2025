    "## Summary & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we walked through the complete workflow for building and integrating PySMO surrogate models into WaterTAP/IDAES flowsheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surrogate Modeling Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation** — Load pump curve data, normalize inputs/outputs, and split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets using `split_training_validation()`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Train the Surrogate** — Use `PysmoPolyTrainer` with configurable options:\n",
    "   - `maximum_polynomial_order`: Controls model complexity\n",
    "   - `multinomials`: Enables interaction terms between inputs\n",
    "   - `number_of_crossvalidations`: For robust model selection\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create Surrogate Object** — Wrap trained expressions with `PysmoSurrogate()`, specifying input/output labels and bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Save & Load** — Persist models to JSON with `save_to_file()` and reload with `load_from_file()` for reuse\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Validate** — Evaluate performance using metrics (MAE, MSE, R²) and visualization (parity plots, residuals)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrating Surrogates into Flowsheets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create **normalized variables** in the flowsheet that match surrogate input/output ranges\n",
    "- Add **linking constraints** to connect normalized variables to physical pump variables (flow, head, power)\n",
    "- Use `SurrogateBlock` to embed the surrogate as algebraic constraints in the Pyomo model\n",
    "- The resulting **hybrid model** combines first-principles mass/energy balances with data-driven pump curves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalization matters** — Surrogates trained on normalized data ([0,1] range) are more numerically stable\n",
    "- **Respect operating bounds** — Only use surrogates within the training data range (e.g., above MCSF for pumps)\n",
    "- **Validate before deploying** — Always check surrogate accuracy on held-out data before embedding in optimization\n",
    "- **Higher-order ≠ better** — PySMO automatically selects polynomial order via cross-validation; more complexity can lead to overfitting"
